This is a simple FVWM WM configuration. Have Fun!

Most of the configuration are copied from: http://zensites.net/fvwm/guide/

I only changed/added/removed some configurations.

### Usage

1. backup and remove your ~/.fvwm directory
2. clone this repo, rename the cloned directory to `~/.fvwm`
4. backup your `~/.Xresources` if necessary and `mv ./Xresources ~/.Xresources && xrdb ~/.Xresources`
5. restart fvwm (exit fvwm if necessary)
