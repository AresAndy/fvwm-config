This is a simple FVWM WM configuration. Have Fun!

Most of the configuration are copied fromï¼› http://zensites.net/fvwm/guide/

I only changed/added/remove some configurations.

### Usage

1. backup and remove your ~/.fvwm directory
2. clone this repo, rename the cloned directory to `~/.fvwm`
3. restart fvwm
